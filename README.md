# Red Team Tactics and Exploitation Lab
This repository contains the findings and results of a penetration testing project conducted on Metasploitable 2, a deliberately vulnerable Linux-based virtual machine used to practice penetration testing skills. This project aimed to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them, and assess the effectiveness of common security practices.

### Project Overview                                                                             
Target: Metasploitable 2 Virtual Machine                                                    
Tools Used: Metasploit, Nmap, SSH, Medusa, and more

## Objectives:                                                                                 
  • Identify and exploit common vulnerabilities (Weak passwords, misconfigurations, unpatched services, etc)                
  • Gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate sensitive data.           
  • Recommend system hardening techniques to secure the target environment.                 

## Key Achievements:                                                                           
  • Successfully exploited a vulnerable version of OpenSSH.                                  
  • Leveraged misconfigurations in Sudo permissions for privilege escalation.                 
  • Conducted brute-force password cracking using Hydra.                                  
  • Extracted sensitive data, including user credentials and system logs.                 
  • Provided actionable recommendations for improving system security based on findings.  

## Skills Developed:                                                                           
  • Penetration testing techniques for web, system, and network vulnerabilities.            
  • Use of Metasploit for automated exploitation and post-exploitation.                     
  • Identification of weaknesses in system configurations and services.                     
  • Ethical hacking and understanding of exploit mitigation.                                  

## Recommendations for Securing the System:                                                    
  • Apply patches for known vulnerabilities                                                   
  • Implement strong password policies and two-factor authentication.                     
  • Regularly audit sudo permissions and remove unnecessary privileges.                    
  • Disable unused services to reduce attack surfaces.
