# Red Team Tactics and Exploitation Lab

This repository documents a hands-on offensive security project targeting **Metasploitable 2**, a vulnerable Linux-based virtual machine. Using **Kali Linux**, this lab simulates real-world attacker tactics to identify exploitable weaknesses, gain unauthorized access, and demonstrate the importance of hardening and secure configuration practices.

## Project Overview

The lab targets **Metasploitable 2**, a vulnerable virtual machine commonly used for penetration testing education. The offensive engagement focuses on discovering vulnerabilities, exploiting them using open-source tools, escalating privileges, and documenting findings for remediation.

---

## Technologies Used

- Kali Linux – Attacker operating system
- Metasploitable 2 – Vulnerable Linux target
- Nmap – Network and service discovery
- Metasploit – Automated exploitation framework
- Hydra & Medusa – Brute-force password cracking tools
- Netcat, SSH, Python – Post-exploitation utilities

---

## Objectives

- Identify common vulnerabilities including outdated services, weak credentials, and insecure configurations  
- Exploit services to achieve unauthorized access and escalate privileges  
- Demonstrate data exfiltration and post-exploitation techniques  
- Provide remediation guidance based on offensive findings  

---

## Key Achievements

- **Discovered and exploited 7+ service vulnerabilities**  
  *Used Nmap and banner grabbing to identify vulnerable versions of OpenSSH, VSFTPD, Samba, and Apache services on Metasploitable 2.*

- **Achieved 3 successful privilege escalations**  
  *Used misconfigured sudo permissions, SUID binaries, and kernel exploits to escalate from limited shell access to root.*

- **Cracked 5 user credentials using brute-force**  
  *Utilized Hydra and Medusa to crack SSH and FTP logins, including accounts with default and weak passwords.*

- **Executed post-exploitation actions on compromised systems**  
  *Enumerated users, extracted hashed passwords, and captured sensitive information from `/etc/shadow`, web server directories, and running processes.*

- **Delivered 6 system hardening recommendations**  
  *Compiled actionable mitigation steps, including service patching, removal of unnecessary packages, sudo audits, and strong authentication enforcement.*

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Penetration Testing Methodology**  
  *Followed a structured attack lifecycle including reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and reporting.*

- **Vulnerability Discovery and Exploitation**  
  *Identified outdated and misconfigured services, developed and launched targeted attacks using Metasploit and manual methods.*

- **Credential Attack Techniques**  
  *Applied brute-force and dictionary attacks against services with exposed login interfaces, simulating real attacker behavior.*

- **Post-Exploitation Enumeration**  
  *Gathered host-based data, escalated access rights, and mapped internal systems using compromised credentials.*

- **Red Team Reporting and Defense Recommendations**  
  *Generated findings and mitigation strategies to strengthen defensive posture based on offensive results.*

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements

- **Simulate Pivoting and Lateral Movement**  
  Add more vulnerable machines to the lab and attempt internal pivoting via compromised hosts.

- **Incorporate Evasion Techniques**  
  Explore AV/IDS evasion with tools like `Veil`, `msfvenom`, and obfuscation scripts.

- **Introduce Logging and Detection Simulation**  
  Integrate basic monitoring tools (e.g., syslog, auditd) to correlate attacks with detectable behavior.

- **Include Exploit Customization**  
  Modify or write custom shellcode and payloads to bypass simple filters or target non-standard ports.

- **Expand to Web Application Exploits**  
  Leverage tools like Burp Suite to identify XSS, SQLi, and RFI vulnerabilities in Metasploitable 2’s web stack.
