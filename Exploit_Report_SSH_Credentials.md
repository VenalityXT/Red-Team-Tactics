# **Exploit 1: Weak SSH Credentials**

## **Discovery Process**                                                            
Conducted an nmap scan of the target to identify open ports and running services:

![NMap Result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3075a08-f803-4d81-94ae-9ac11b7a4405)

Identified the SSH service running on port 22 with version OpenSSH 4.7p1.                                                              
This version is outdated and lacks modern security configurations.
 
## **Exploitation:**                                                            
Used Medusa to perform a brute-force attack against the SSH service.

The Medusa tool was chosen for its efficiency in parallel authentication attempts.                                                            
The rockyou.txt wordlist was used to attempt common password combinations.

### Explanation of Command:                                                            

__-h 192.168.1.184:__ Specifies the Metasploitable VM host.                                                            
__-u msfadmin:__ Specifies the username to attack.                                                            
__-P passwords:__ Specifies the path to the wordlist we use in the brute-force attack.                                                            
__-M ssh:__ Specifies the module to use (in this case, SSH).

Successfully obtained the root credentials:

__Username:__ msfadmin                                                            
__Password:__ msfadmin                                                            

Gaining root access via SSH provided full control over the Metasploitable VM.                                                            
*For lab purposes, we can assume the password was anything easily aquired through brute-force techniques.*

### Proof of Work:                                                            
After obtaining the credentials, logged in to the SSH service to verify access:

## **Recommendations for Mitigation:**                                                            

1. Enforce Strong Password Policies:                                                            
    - Use a minimum password length of 12 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

2. Disable Root Login via SSH:                                                            
    - Edit the SSH configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) to disable root login:

3. Enable Key-Based Authentication:                                                            
    - Require SSH key pairs instead of password-based authentication to reduce the risk of brute-force attacks.

4. Use Rate-Limiting and Intrusion Prevention Tools:                                                            
    - Install fail2ban to block IPs after multiple failed login attempts
